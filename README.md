## About this project

This is a web page layout project I developed for practice, primarily utilizing Next.js and Tailwind. It showcases the homepage of a fashion e-commerce site, featuring a visually appealing design composed of classic UI components.

The layout is responsive (RWD), adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes on different devices. Feel free to explore the page and observe how the layout transforms across screens of different dimensions.
